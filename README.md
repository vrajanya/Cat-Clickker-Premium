# Cat Clicker Premium

'Cat Clicker Premium' is build as a part of [Udacity's Javascript Design Patterns course](https://www.udacity.com/course/javascript-design-patterns--ud989).

Its a single page web application that display a list of cats &amp; a selected cat with a click counter using MVO JavaScript frameworks.
 
## Project Requirements
### Visuals
 The application should display
* a list of cats by name
* an area to display the selected cat
* In the cat display area, the following should be displayed
   **the cat's name
   **a picture of the cat
   **text showing the number of clicks
   **The specifics of the layout do not matter, so style it however you'd like.

### Interaction
* When a cat name is clicked in the list, the cat display area should update to show the data for the selected cat.
* The number of clicks in the cat area should be unique to each cat, and should increment when the cat's picture is clicked.

### Future Enhancements

* an admin button
* an admin area with inputs for changing the cat's name, url, and number of clicks (hidden by default)
* When the admin button is clicked, the admin area should appear with the inputs filled in for the currently-selected cat.
* When the cancel button in the admin area is pressed, the admin area disappears.
* When the save button in the admin area is pressed, the currently-selected cat's values update with the values in the admin area, and the   admin area disappears.
